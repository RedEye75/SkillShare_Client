            For those who have never encountered online learning, the biggest
            question is often what it is actually like. The caveat, as you know,
            is that online learning comes in several forms. Therefore, this is
            your chance to explain that to people. Point out that there are
            different types of online courses and programs, and that they’ll
            have to decide which is best for them. Then, explain the types of
            courses you offer and how your online programs work to give them all
            the information they need. This not only gives them information, but
            it increases their trust because you’re being transparent and giving
            them straightforward answers.

            This is another common question that people have about online
            courses. There are usually self-paced programs and traditional
            classroom or meeting-style programs available. Today’s world is full
            of busy people that want to better themselves, so the self-paced
            programs are popular. Whether or not you provide this option, be
            sure to answer this question for people and explain the pros and
            cons of each type of learning. As a bonus, you can even invite them
            to contact you for more information or to discuss what their options
            are.

            All new learning innovations are met with some degree of scrutiny,
            but skepticism subsides as methods become more mainstream. Such is
            the case for online learning. Studies indicate employers who are
            familiar with online degrees tend to view them more favorably, and
            more employers are acquainted with them than ever before. The
            majority of colleges now offer online degrees, including most
            public, not-for-profit, and Ivy League universities. Online learning
            is also increasingly prevalent in the workplace as more companies
            invest in web-based employee training and development programs.

            As with traditional colleges, some online schools are considered
            more credible than others. Reputation, post-graduation employment
            statistics, and enrollment numbers are not always reliable
            indicators of quality, which is why many experts advise students to
            look for accredited schools. In order for an online college to be
            accredited, a third-party organization must review its practices,
            finances, instructors, and other important criteria and certify that
            they meet certain quality standards. The certifying organization
            matters, too, since accreditation is only as reliable as the agency
            that grants it. Students should confirm online programs’ accrediting
            agencies are recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and/or
            the Council on Higher Education Accreditation before submitting
            their applications.
